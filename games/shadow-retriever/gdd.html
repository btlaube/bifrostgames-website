    <h1>Shadow Retriever</h1>
    <h2>Game Design Document</h2>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Made by BifrostGames</strong></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <h3>Game Summary</h3>
    <p>A metroidvania platformer about navigating through an alchemist’s library to retrieve their lost artifacts.</p>

    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
    <p>Hollowknight, Apollo</p>

    <h3>Player Experience</h3>
    <p>Single-screen platformer rooms for 6 levels including a lock-and-key style progression in the form of areas that require the player to unlock certain abilities before accessing. As the player unlocks new abilities, the platforming will reflect this in the form of new hazard/obstacle types and layouts specifically designed to test the player’s use of their movement abilities.</p>

    <h3>Platform</h3>
    <p>Developed to run on the web.</p>

    <h3>Development Software</h3>
    <p>Unity (engine), Aseprite & Gimp (art), Audacity & Waveform (Music & SFX)</p>

    <h3>Genre</h3>
    <p>Metroidvania, platformer</p>

    <h3>Target Audience</h3>
    <p>Incorporating tried-and-true platforming elements, this game offers an approachable experience to the casual gamer. Gamers with metroidvania experience will find the platforming challenging yet familiar.</p>

    <h2>Concept</h2>
    <h3>Gameplay Overview</h3>
    <p>The player controls a shadow brought to life by an alchemist, and is tasked with retrieving the alchemist’s lost alchemical artifacts. The shadow will venture forth to complete platforming challenges to reach and claim the lost artifacts, which upon collection grant the player further movement abilities, increasing both their movement capabilities and the difficulty of platforming.</p>

    <h3>Theme Interpretation “Shadows and Alchemy”</h3>
    <p>The alchemist sends their shadow to retrieve alchemical artifacts. Combine the twisted and misunderstood nature of alchemy with the ghostliness and fluidity of shadows. Challenging platforming may make the tone hopeless at times but the player uses their alchemical movement abilities to push ahead. Collecting the final ability brings the player a sense of satisfaction, which is not reflected in the alchemist’s less than enthusiastic congratulations for completing their bidding. The game leaves the player triumphant yet disappointed, reflecting the futility of alchemical “science” and the dynamic yet stagnant nature of shadows.</p>

    <h2>Primary Mechanics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Move: A/D, left arrow/right arrow</li>
        <li>Jump: Space, up arrow</li>
        <li>Drop (through platform): down arrow</li>
        <li>Interact: X</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Secondary Mechanics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Double jump</li>
        <li>Wall cling/wall jump</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Art</h2>
    <h3>Theme Interpretation</h3>
    <p>Scale is a key element to both the mechanics and the art. Objects will be designed to make sense logically as either big or small. True size must be determined by context (grid shape, item use, etc.).</p>

    <h2>Audio</h2>
    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p>Alchemy - twisted science magic - haunting baroque tone. Balance music tone with player emotion. Challenging gameplay leads to frustrated players. Calm music tone contrasts the challenging gameplay but may serve to calm the player subconsciously. A more upbeat score may accentuate the stress caused by the platforming challenges or overwhelm the player.</p>

    <h3>Sound Effects</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Player - accentuate shadow aspect in sfx</li>
        <li>Timed Hazards - clear indication of danger</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Game Experience</h2>
    <h3>UI</h3>
    <p>Minimal UI</p>

    <h3>Controls</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Horizontal movement - left/right arrow, A/D</li>
        <li>Jump - up arrow, W</li>
        <li>Drop (through platform) - down arrow, S</li>
    </ul>
