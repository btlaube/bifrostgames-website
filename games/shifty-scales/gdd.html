        <h2>Concept</h2>
        <h3>Gameplay Overview</h3>
        <p>In "Shifty Scales," players take on the role of a clever and somewhat shady shop owner who specializes in resizing and adjusting items for customers. Using a unique machine, the player must swap the scales of various objects, resizing them to meet the specific needs of each customer.</p>

        <h3>Game Flow</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Receiving Orders:</strong> Each level begins with a customer entering the shop and presenting a request, which typically includes mis-sized items.</li>
            <li><strong>Analyzing Clues:</strong> Players must carefully examine clues provided by the customer to determine the correct size for each item.</li>
            <li><strong>Swapping Scales:</strong> Using the Scale Swap Machine, players swap sizes of two items at a time.</li>
            <li><strong>Arranging Items:</strong> After resizing, players may need to arrange the items into specific grids or attach them together.</li>
            <li><strong>Completing the Order:</strong> Once satisfied, the player submits the order for the customer, with feedback based on accuracy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Puzzle Complexity</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Early Levels:</strong> Simple puzzles introducing mechanics.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Levels:</strong> More complex puzzles with multiple items and ambiguous clues.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Challenge and Replayability</h3>
        <p>Players can replay levels for perfect scores, based on accuracy and efficiency.</p>

        <h2>Theme Interpretation “Built to Scale”</h2>
        <p>The player uses a machine built to scale objects up or down to complete customer orders.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Primary Mechanics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Clicking and dragging items into the scale swap machine.</li>
            <li>Resizing items into shape grids.</li>
        </ul>

    <section>
        <h2>Secondary Mechanics</h2>
        <p>Sending and receiving orders from customers.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Art</h2>
        <h3>Theme Interpretation</h3>
        <p>Scale is a key element in both the mechanics and the art. Objects are designed logically as big or small, with true size determined by context.</p>

        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>Puzzle theme inspired by Professor Layton games, with colors ranging from browns, tans, muted maroons, and dark blues. The design features old-timey, steampunk items like horn speaker crank radios, pocket watches, and ornate cutlery.</p>
