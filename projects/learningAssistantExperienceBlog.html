        <h1>About</h1><a href="./learningAssistantExperienceBlog">to top</a>
        <p>This webpage was designed as the final project for UHON 99H: Honors Experiences. The blog serves as a reflective platform where I document and share my experiences as a Course Leader for CSCE 155A. The blog will be coded from scratch, allowing me to apply and showcase my coding skills, which are directly relevant to my major as well as the content of the course. Each blog post will delve into specific aspects of my experience, such as teaching strategies, challenges faced, and the insights gained.</p>
        <p>My primary goal is to apply my coding skills to create a visually appealing and functional blog that showcases my experience as a Course Leader and the many applicable skills and lessons I have learned.</p>

            <h1>Learning Assistant Program (LAP) Training Workshop</h1>
            <h2 class="date">August 19, 2023</h2>
            <h3 class="tags">Tags: "Key Events"</h3>
            <p>Before the semester starts the Learning Assitant Program hosts a Traning Workshop that is required for all Learning Assistants and Course Leaders, and is run by the Senior Leaders. The goal of the workshop is to introduce new LAs to the way the program works, what they will be doing, etc. and  offers a reminder to the returning LAs and CLs.</p>
            <p>This is my 3rd semester with program but my first semester as a Course Leader, so most of the information was review but some was new and helpful. I took careful note of changes within the program since last year in case my lesson plans need to be updated.</p>
            <p>The workshop was also a great time to reconnect with fellow LAs after the summer off.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As I mentioned, this is my first semester as a Course Leader. What does that mean? Well, a Learning Assistant has to hold office hours, run weekly lab sections, and grade assignments; there are about 5 LAs for this course. A Course Leader does everything a LA does with the addition of weekly meeting course intructors and senior leaders, bridging the communication gap between instructor/program and LAs, assigning grading, and quality checking grading.</p>

            <p>This is my third semester going through the initial set up (i.e. a terminal or other coding environment), so I am familiar with common issues and can troubleshoot quickly and efficiently. This semester posed some new challenges as the School of Computing started using a new linux server.</p>
            <p>I was given the information about the new server ahead of time, and was able to smoothly guide each student to setting up their CSE accounts and connecting to the server.</p>

            <h1>Answering A Request from A Learning Assistant</h1>
            <h2 class="date">September 4th, 2023</h2>
            <h3 class="tags">Tags: "Issues Resolved", "Lessons and Skills"</h3>
            <p>Today I got a request from a Learning Assistant. They asked to see a solution to the coding assignment to better help students. I thought it would idea for the Learning Assistants to have access for a solution, especially one that the instructor had written.</p>
            <p>A solution could be useful for the LAs because they could use it to learn more about the students or prepare better answers to students' questions.</p>
            <p>At a meeting with the instructors, I brought up the LA's question, and was able to convince the instructors that it was a good idea.</p>
            <p>I got solution code and gave it to the other LAs and made sure to explain the best way to use the code to assist in their teaching. I made sure to highlight a few key things:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't show the code (the code should be used as reference only).</li>
                <li>This solution is not the only solution. If a student has another solution, then help them with their solution.</li>
                <li>Stay vague and try to lead the student to the answer as opposed to telling them outright.</li>

            <h1>Getting IDEs Installed</h1>
            <h2 class="date">September 6th, 2023</h2>
            <div class="tags">Tags: "Issues Resolved"</div>
            <p>This week we had our first assignment that required students to run python code locally from their personal machines. Up until now they most students had been writing code using vim on the CSE server and all students had been running their python code on the CSE server.</p>
            <p>This assignment required the use of a library not on the CSE server, so, during lab this week, I went through the process of getting students set up with their first Integrated Development Environment (IDE).</p>
            <p>People often forget about the set up process that is required before you can start writing code. There are often any number of unexpected errors. After three semesters of going through the same process, I still encounter new errors. However, I have gained plenty of experience helping programming beginners through this process.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Going through this process has developed my ability to proactively react to novel issues and quickly create solutions. Such as skill is appliable in any work environment.</p>

            <p>I also noticed that the students started using the whiteboard system to create a queue that I had only seen the students of larger classes use in the past. This could be becsause CSCE 155A class is a much larger section this semester.</p>
            <p>The whiteboard system seemed to work really well. It made office hours go smoothly and I helped one student after the other.</p>

            <h1>Preparing A Short Lesson on 2D Arrays</h1>
            <h2 class="date">September 13th, 2023</h2>
            <h3 class="tags">Tags: "Issue Resolved"</h3>
            <p>Navigating the complexities of 2D arrays in an introductory computer science course can be daunting for beginners. Recognizing the need for a streamlined solution, I, as a Learning Assistant, implemented a visual approach to demystify this fundamental programming tool.</p>
            <p>In response to recurring student struggles, I utilized the whiteboard to visually represent 2D arrays as grids – a list of lists of elements. Connecting this new concept with their existing understanding of lists, I supplemented the visualizations with concise code examples. By demonstrating how to access elements using two indices, I clarified the grid-like structure, where indices correspond to row and column coordinates.</p>
            <p>This visual and practical strategy proved remarkably efficient in helping students comprehend the nuances of 2D arrays. By seamlessly integrating theory with hands-on examples, the approach provides a concise and effective foundation, empowering students to confidently tackle programming challenges.</p>

                <p>I was able to ask them about how the semester has been, how the work load has been, etc. I got some good notes and some feedback to share with the instructors.</p>
