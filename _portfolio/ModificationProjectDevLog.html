            <h1>Dev Log 0: Project Creation and Exploration</h1>
            <h2>September 18, 2023</h2>
            <p>I started by creating a Unity project for both the FPS Microgame and Karting Microgame learning templates. 
                I originally planned on using the FPS Microgame template to make a 3rd person shooter game; 
                however, after playing around a bit with both projects and taking a look at the provided tutorials I decided to make a variation
                of the Karting Microgame. </p>
            <p>I then went through some of the tutorials that came with the Karting Microgame template to better familiarize myself with the structure of the project.</p>
            <p>My goals for the project are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add additional driver and kart assets &lpar;maybe with a character selection screen&rpar;</li>
                <li>Adjust player movement for smoother driving and possible include differnt "Characters" with different stats</li>
                <li>Add a speed boost pad</li>
                <li>Create at least 1 custom track &lpar;hopefully more&rpar;</li>
                <li>Add custom sound effects and music</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some stretch goals:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add a ghost driver to race against your best time</li>
                <li>Add local multiplayer</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Dev Log 1: Making Custom Track and Adding Assets</h1>
            <h2>September 19, 2023</h2>
            <div class="image-text-container">
                <p>Today I added a speed pad to my track, which I thought would involve coding, but it came prebuilt as a prefab in the project.</p>
                <p>I also got a first draft of the 1 custom track I wanted to make. I found a city asset pack on the Unity Asset Store and added
                a few building models from the pack to my scene.</p>
