            <h2>September 18, 2023</h2>
            <p>Started by creating a Unity project for both the FPS Microgame and Karting Microgame learning templates. 
                I originally planned on using the FPS Microgame template to make a 3rd person shooter game; 
                however, after playing around a bit with both projects and taking a look at the provided tutorials I decided to make a variation
                of the Karting Microgame. </p>
