            <h1>Dev Log 0: Initial Ideation</h1>
            <h2>September 25, 2023</h2>
            <p>
                In class on Monday, we had some time to brainstorm for our Personal Project. Professor Carletto-Leon had mentioned that October is 
                the perfect time to make a horror game which immediately made me inspired to make a something spooky. I knew I wanted to make a game 
                that had a twist and leave the player shocked. I thought back to a game I had been working on over the summer about some friends on a camping 
                trip that decide to smoke weed and end up hallucinating that they were being attacked by monsters. I thought it would be a clever twist to make 
                the player's friends the "Red-eyed Monsters" that is revealed as a twist at the end of the game. It would add to the shock and horror if the player 
                ends up killing their friends thinking they were defending themselves from a beast. I now realize that this is also what happens in the movie The Village 
                except she was blind and not on drugs.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this project I want to focus on the visual aspect. I want to create visuals that are reminiscent of old indie-horror games. I found an interesting 
                method to give the game a pixelated look by rendering the camera view to a render texture, then putting the render texture onto a large image on a canvas. 
                I can even set the exact pixel ratio of the render texture to get the perfect resolution. Low-poly 3D assets will look really good and vintage rendered at this low resolution.

            <h1>Dev Log 1: Player Movement</h1>
            <h2>September 27, 2023</h2>
            <p>
                Didn't do a ton today, but I got the beginnings of a 3D first person player movement script working. The movement is incredibly important for this game 
                as it is most of the gameplay and it is what connects the player to the game world. The better that connection is the scarier the game will be.

            <h1>Dev Log 2: Finalizing Player Movement</h1>
            <h2>September 28, 2023</h2>
            <p>
                I started today by creating a basic environment to test my player movement in. I added a plane, and some stretched cubes to be walls.
            </p>
            <p>
                After trying for too long to use the mouse to control the player's gaze, I ended up giving up and getting a prebuilt first person 
                player controller from the Unity Asset Store. I modified the code to use Unity's new input system because I want to be able to play 
                this game with mouse and keyboard or controller. The asset also came with crouch, sprint, and jump which may come in handy. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, the asset came with an audio manager for footsteps, jump sound, crouch sounds, etc. The sounds were really good right off 
                the bat; however, I slowed the player movement way down, so I also had to pitch down all of the audio sources. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The last thing I added was a dynamic camera bob to simulate walking that adjusts when the player sprints. With the camera bob, repitched 
                audio, and slowed movement the player controller was finished. I really like how it turned out, and it is the perfect horror vibe I was going for.

            <h1>Dev Log 3: In-class Lab Time</h1>
            <h2>October 4, 2023</h2>
            <p>
                During our in-class lab time I was able to do some experimenting with lighting and materials.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want the scene to be dark, but it can't be completely dark (the player has to be able to see something). I originally set up my
                moon as a sphere that was very far away from the player and very large. This created a nice effect of the moon always being the same.
                size in the sky even if the player walked towards it. I then used a combination of a few components to create the moon's lighting effects.
                First I made the moon texture have an emmision. This made the moon visible without illuminating the scene. Next, I used two directional lights:
                one aimed at the moon to further illuminate the sphere, and another aimed away from the moon to act as the light coming from the moon and to illuminate
                the scene. After some experimenting, I decided that just making the moon's material an emitter was enough and made the scene dark enough but not too dark.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also messed around with a 3D character model. A big goal of mine is to create a properly horrifying monster for my game. A huge inspiration for me
                is The Beast from Over the Garden Wall. In OTGW, The Beast is always depicted as a creepy sillihuet until the end, when The Beast's true form is illuminated for
                just a few frames. I want to emulate that same horror with my monster. I want the model to be a sillihuet with glowing red eyes. So far,
                I have not figured out a way to make a 3D model that is both darker than the surrounding area and yet still visible. I have a few ideas that I will test in the future.
                One of which is to have the monster always illuminated from the back.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, I talked to Professor Francesca about level design, which I had been putting off thinking about. I will have to experiment, but I
                I think I will go with a mostly open area with choke points to help guide the player. I plan on using the Slenderman map as inspiration.
