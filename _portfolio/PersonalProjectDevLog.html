            <h2>September 25, 2023</h2>
            <p>
                In class on Monday, we had some time to brainstorm for our Personal Project. Professor Carletto-Leon had mentioned that October is 
                the perfect time to make a horror game which immediately made me inspired to make a something spooky. I knew I wanted to make a game 
                that had a twist and leave the player shocked. I thought back to a game I had been working on over the summer about some friends on a camping 
                trip that decide to smoke weed and end up hallucinating that they were being attacked by monsters. I thought it would be a clever twist to make 
                the player's friends the "Red-eyed Monsters" that is revealed as a twist at the end of the game. It would add to the shock and horror if the player 
                ends up killing their friends thinking they were defending themselves from a beast. I know realize that this is also what happens in the movie The Village 
                except she was blind and not on drugs.

                For this project I want to focus on the visual aspect. I want to create visuals that are reminiscent of old indie-horror games. I found an interesting 
                method to give the game a pixelated look by rendering the camera view to a render texture, then putting the render texture onto a large image on a canvas. 
                I can even set the exact pixel ratio of the render texture to get the perfect resolution. Low-poly 3D assets will look really good and vintage rendered at this low resolution.

            <h1>Dev Log 1: Player Movement</h1>
            <h2>September 27, 2023</h2>
            <p>
                Didn't do a ton today, but I got the beginnings of a 3D first person player movement script working. The movement is incredibly important for this game 
                as it is most of the gameplay and it is what connects the player to the game world. The better that connection is the scarier the game will be.

            <h1>Dev Log 2: Finalizing Player Movement</h1>
            <h2>September 28, 2023</h2>
            <p>
                I started today by creating a basic environment to test my player movement in. I added a plane, and some stretched cubes to be walls.
            </p>
            <p>
                After trying for too long to use the mouse to control the player's gaze, I ended up giving up and getting a prebuilt first person 
                player controller from the Unity Asset Store. I modified the code to use Unity's new input system because I want to be able to play 
                this game with mouse and keyboard or controller. The asset also came with crouch, sprint, and jump which may come in handy. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, the asset came with an audio manager for footsteps, jump sound, crouch sounds, etc. The sounds were really good right off 
                the bat; however, I slowed the player movement way down, so I also had to pitch down all of the audio sources. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The last thing I added was a dynamic camera bob to simulate walking that adjusts when the player sprints. With the camera bob, repitched 
                audio, and slowed movement the player controller was finished. I really like how it turned out, and it is the perfect horror vibe I was going for.
